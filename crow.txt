(Fix USB disconnect issues - all options)
Assuming you have set your power profile to high (Windows) with nothing suspending.

Best advice I can offer is to clean house on your USB devices. Unplug everything but your keyboard / mouse and then run something like USBView to take a look at what is still hanging around. Delete everything except your keyboard and mouse.
Reboot your system, go to Device Manager and look at Devices By Type and then USB. Pay attention to the the various hubs and make sure the "Allow Computer To Power Down Device, or whatever it's called, is UNCHECKED.

Now, take a look at your motherboard manual and try to isolate your audio interface on it's own USB controller. Keep checking Device Manager and USBView as you plug in devices to see where they are being assigned. Your manual should list the physical ports, where you actually plug the cable in, and what controllers they are attached to.
Again, the object is to isolate your audio interface on it's own controller.
If that is not possible, then put it on a controller with a low impact device like an iLok or Steinberg key etc.


With some experimentation and a careful read of the manual, you should be able to design a great setup.

I agree this should all just work, but sometimes it doesn't and this procedure will at least give you a fighting chance.

Oh yea, with some systems and configurations, you can plug anything into any socket and it will just work.
When it doesn't, you need to dig deeper.

Best of luck !

P.S. Make sure to check the "Allow Power Down" status of the hubs after every Microsoft Windows update because Windows seems to like to reset this parameter.
